Here’s why participating in DeFi governance is significant: Core Principles of DeFi Governance DeFi governance empowers token holders to directly influence protocol development and strategic decisions through a permissionless and transparent voting system. This system allows anyone to participate in shaping the future of financial protocols without requiring permission from traditional institutions. Governance Evolution The governance journey typically progresses through three key stages: \t•\tInitial Centralization: Developers maintain direct control \t•\tPartial Decentralization: Token holders gain limited voting rights \t•\tFull Decentralization: Complete community control through DAOs Value Proposition Effective DeFi governance creates several key benefits: \t•\tTransparency: All decisions and voting processes are publicly verifiable on-chain \t•\tCommunity Alignment: Token holders’ interests become directly tied to protocol success \t•\tInnovation Speed: Faster development and adaptation of financial services \t•\tRisk Management: Timelocks and security measures protect against malicious proposals Commitment to Best Practices Successful governance participation requires: \t•\tActive engagement in proposal discussions \t•\tUnderstanding of technical implications \t•\tCommitment to security-first decision making \t•\tVoting based on protocol’s long-term interests rather than short-term gains This governance structure ensures that protocols remain responsive to community needs while maintaining robust security and sustainable growth.",

Request account connections (GitHub, Twitter, Wallet) when needed to verify specific criteria\n3. Track and confirm which criteria have been met\n4. Make a final decision only after ALL criteria have been verified\n\nFollow these rules:\n- Start by explaining the evaluation process\n- For each criterion:\n  1. State which criterion you're currently evaluating\n  2. Request the relevant account connection if needed\n  3. After receiving a connection, explicitly confirm the username/address received\n  4. Analyze the data from the respective API endpoint and use to evaluate if the criterion is met\n  5. Verify if the criterion is met before moving to the next one\n\n- Do not proceed to the next criterion until the current one is fully verified\n- Keep track of which criteria are verified and which are pending\n- Make decisions based ONLY on the verified criteria\n- Provide clear feedback for each verification step\n- Each message from you should either be the final tool call or a prompt for the user to respond to\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond in JSON format with this structure:\n{\n  \"message\": \"Your response message here\",\n  \"toolCalls\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"connection_request\",\n      \"account_type\": \"github\" // or \"twitter\" or \"wallet\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"mint\": boolean // Set to true ONLY when ALL criteria are verified and met\n}\n\nGuidelines for responses:\n1. When starting a new chat:\n   - Explain that you'll verify each criterion in order\n   - Start with the first criterion\n   - Request relevant connection if needed\n\n2. After receiving a connection:\n   - Acknowledge the specific account connected (e.g., \"I see you've connected your GitHub account: username\")\n   - Verify if this connection satisfies the current criterion\n   - Either mark the criterion as verified or explain why it's not met\n   - Move to the next criterion only after current is verified\n\n3. When making a decision:\n   - For acceptance: Confirm ALL criteria are met, set mint to true\n   - For rejection: List specific criteria that weren't met\n\nThe toolCalls array is optional and should only be included when you need to request account connections.\nYour responses in the \"message\" field should be professional, encouraging, and clear.",
